We are trying to implement the photoshop canvas which should have mouse up and mouse down events. Both should do different things depending upon tool selected.

This also implements Open Closed principle.


We should not abuse design patterns and try to fit them everywhere. Like we could have used state design pattern in a stopwatch, but is it necessary.
Since stopwatch could only be in stopped state or running state.
