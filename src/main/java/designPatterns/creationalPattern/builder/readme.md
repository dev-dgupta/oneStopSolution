Best is used when you have many optional and few mandatory parameters in a class.

So for a User class, username and email is a mandatory parameter, whereas last name, age and work could be optional parameters.
At the time of sign up user can give first name and email, and then update the rest of the information.


So we can build the parameters, depending upon the information we have, and then later update the fields using getters and setters.
