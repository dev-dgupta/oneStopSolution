Abstract factory lets you create family of related objects.
Creates multiple objects present in same factory.

What does related objects mean?:

Related objects mean that objects that go with each other.
for example, you are buying an Volkswagon car, then you would want
that the car has engine of the Volkswagon company only and not Tata Motors.
Similarly the wheels should also be of Volkswagon company.
This imples, that the car, its engine and its wheels are related objects
depicting a family.
Similarly, if you are a furniture shop owner then, if a person comes to 
you to buy a plastic chair, then you would also show him a plastic table.
And if a customer asks you for a wooden table, then you would also show 
him a wooden chair, instead of plastic chair.
So the wooden chairs and table are one family, whereas
the plastic chair and table are another family.
